### Hi there üëã
I'm Nikhil Patel, a master's student studying computer science at UMich!

üí° I'm currently working on:

<ul>
      <li><b>Parallel Monte Carlo LSM</b>: Parallelizing Least-Squares Monte Carlo simulations for pricing path dependent options. I'm using openmp to construct a manager that is able to dynamically allocate threads between simulating and regressing in order to achieve comparable accuracy to a sequential algorithm while enjoying a linear speedup with increased processor counts.</li>
      <li><b>Budget Constrainted Influence Maximization of Crypto Price through Airdrops</b>: Uses agent-based modeling to investigate the emergence of herding behavior in Crypto markets under different conditions and the role of airdrops and reputation through the lens of a budget-constrained maximization problem.</li>
      <li><b>AlphaMax</b>: A Proximal Policy Optimizing agent that captures asset price dynamics, market volatility, and non-linear relationships through Geometric Brownian Motion modeling, Kalman Filtering, and Fourier-Based Spectral Estimation.</li>
      <li><b>AlphaTax</b>:A comprehensive machine learning pipeline that incorporates dimensionality reduction techniques and regressive models such as GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to construct a portfolio of stocks that accurately reflects the performance of a particular target stock with specific applications in Tax-Loss Harvesting.</li>
