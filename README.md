💡 I'm currently working on:

<ul>
      <li><b>AlphaMax</b>: A Proximal Policy Optimizing agent that captures asset price dynamics, market volatility, and non-linear relationships through Geometric Brownian Motion modeling, Kalman Filtering, and Fourier-Based Spectral Estimation.</li>
      <li><b>AlphaTax</b>:A comprehensive machine learning pipeline that incorporates dimensionality reduction techniques and regressive models such as GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to construct a portfolio of stocks that accurately reflects the performance of a particular target stock with specific applications in Tax-Loss Harvesting.</li>
